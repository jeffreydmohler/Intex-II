    "description": "Siamo Cristina e Ilaria, due amiche con la passione per l'Africa e legate sentimentalmente con due guerrieri masai della Tanzania con cui abbiamo due splendide figlie.   Trascorriamo mesi vivendo in remoti villaggi della savana e cercando di dare un contributo alla comunità masai locale portando vestiti, in particolare felpe per le fredde notti del bush, medicine di cui hanno bisogno e aiutando nell'acquisto di beni di prima necessità.   Questa volta però abbiamo un progetto ben più ampio che da sole non potremmo realizzare: vorremmo creare 2 pozzi per l'acqua e abbiamo bisogno di voi.   Ne vorremmo creare uno per ogni comunità dei nostri guerrieri che sono lontani dall'altra: la prima si chiama Msomera ed è un minuscolo villaggio remoto non facile da raggiungere se non in moto.   Cristina arrivò lì nel 2015 e rimase scioccata nel vedere la fatica dei giovani guerrieri e delle donne che si calavano in grosse buche scavate nel terreno per riemire i loro secchi e li tiravano su pieni e pesanti grazie ad un passaggio di mani.   L'acqua era marrone e fangosa e purtroppo disponibile disponibile.   Qualche anno dopo venne costruito un lago artificiale grandissimo e tutto è filato liscio fino a pochi mesi fa quando le abbondanti piogge hanno fatto franare parte del lago che adesso non esiste più.   Vorremmo creare un pozzo dove la gente può avere acqua pulita senza dover faticare e spezzarsi la schiena sotto il peso dei secchi.   L'altro pozzo invece lo vorremmo costruire vicino al meno isolato villaggio di Kiberashi, dove la popolazione comunque dove camminare ben 30 minuti ed oltre per arrivare all '  acqua sotto la calura del sole africano e portando sulla testa pesanti secchi.   Ci auguriamo di cuore e grazie al vostro supporto di poter aiutare concretamente queste comunità messe a dura prova dalla povertà e dalle sempre più frequenti calamità naturali dovute anche ai cambiamenti climatici.

    "description": "It all started in 2017, the gutters on my 1960 year old house failed, flooding most of the front of my house. I was out of my home for 4 mos. during remediation. I lost my 2 part-time jobs that I had at the time, and I have been thrown one challenge after another, from an undetermined sprinkler leak that cost me over $1,500. that I had to pay to the city of Fullerton, to Lawyer fees to win back the \"Property Deed\" to my home.  I am not looking to sell my home, I am looking to save my home!.  I am usually the one helping others through their crisis, bringing the Joy! But, now I am having to appeal to others, who might have gone through what I am going through now, or just want to give a little joy themselves. Every little bit helps, hack away at the daily compound interest that I am now being charged by the Orange County Treasurer.  I have survived these last three years of hardship with my unwavering faith and come out stronger for it! I am a survivor, and a force for good, an, I am determined to rise up from the ashes, and reinvent my life!  I just need a little help from my team of friends, community, my faith, and my higher-ups.  I believe in Miracles, I see them happen all time...I am hoping for a special Miracle this year to save my Home.",

    "description": "My wife and I live in king county Washington which as you may know is the epicenter of the coronavirus covid19 in the United States everyday is a struggle and every single day it's only seeming to get more and more difficult for us and this virus going around is a big part of the problem yet there's something else my wife and I have been dealing with since before this whole epidemic even started. 2 words kidney cancer. My wife has the absolute strongest will to live and 2 overcome extraordinarily difficult circumstances more so than anyone I've ever seen. Everyday she manages to keep going regardless of the pain she feels every second of every day. I promise you the extent of which is astronomical to such a point even when shes able to sleep she tell me there's no relief from the pain she feels. We don't have the money to hire someone to help her out with doing things so I care for her the best I possibly can because I love her more than anything and anyone else I have before yet i fear its not enough especially since being there for her all the time makes it near impossible to keep a steady job. Honestly though I'm starting to feel a bit defeated and extremely overwhelmed since the beginning of our relationship I was aware because of her epilepsy there would be challenges not every normal couple faces that's perfectly fine with me. Then when we found out about the cancer it felt like being sucker punched by Mike Tyson right in the gut. After which we've had ups and downs yet as of lately there's been far more downs. Still we try to maintain some sort of positivity for the chance of a better tomorrow. With everything happening with and around us especially after finding out where we are living is the coronavirus covid 19s epicenter of the whole United States and people with pre underlining health conditions are far more susceptible and likely to die if they get infected aka my wife they say for people who get infected that already have renal conditions the virus can make some people's kidney simply stop working and fail all together so on top of all we're facing there's also now that to worry us and fact in the back of our minds none stop.... Bottom line we need help I honestly don't know what else to attempt to do but ask for help so anybody please help us anyway you can anything helps. We would be extremely thankful for whatever kindness support anybody can help us with.",

    "description": "Dear sponsor, I write you in the name of the family Esqueque from Alotenango en Guatemala.   I got to know this beautiful family in 2010. Their children attended to the school in their village that was build for the most vulnerable families who couldn't pay to go the public school. The family Esqueque attended to a program we started for the families to teach them about education in their homes. That's when they conquered my heart. In the picture you can see the father Carlos, his wife Maria-Elena, and their 4 children: Pedro, María del Carmen, Rosalinda and Anali. In 2010 father Carlos was strugling to find a job to maintain his family. He found a job in a hotel in Antigua, a turistic village nearby. I was very happy for the family. The wages were meager but they could increase a little bit their standard of living.   This month, the corona virus arrived in Guatemala. The hotel where Carlos worked closed his doors. Carlos got fired. Unfortunately, in Guatemala unemployment benefits don't exist. Carlos succeeded to contact me, desperate by the financial situation his family is in.  I have to trie to help them. I proposed to try to rase money through GoFundMe. They were so happy to hear that there might be coming some financial support. Sponsoring this family will mean the world to me, and to them. It will give them food on the table and the possibility for the children to continue to go to school. So they can build a better future for themselves. Carlos has build 1 room for his family where everyone sleeps together in 2 beds. It's his dream to be able to build a second room to have more space for his family. Your funding will help to make their dreams come through!  The money goes directly to the family, sent by Western Union, to father Carlos.   Thank you so much in advance!

    "description": "Please donate to the #WhereDoWeGoBerk Campaign. We are raising money for tents and other winter supplies for the Seabreeze and the I-80 University Underpass homeless encampments.  Each of these encampments experienced increased and repeated Caltrans evictions where they lost tents, storage tubs, and their belongings. Tents provide shelter. Storage tubs provide food protection from the rats. Garbage and waste management mitigate health and safety risks. The residents of these encampments are being proactive by starting their own campaign to improve their living conditions and prepare for winter. We are asking you to help us please.   KC, one of our elders, who is disabled and cannot walk, moved 7 times in 3 weeks. She lost her tent, mattress and many of her belongings. After Caltrans evictions, she had to sleep under a boat sail on a metal bed frame. Thanks to Todd Jersey, a local Berkeley architect, we purchased a new yurt for KC so that she could have shelter and get her wheelchair easily inside. We still need to weatherproof her Yurt and provide her with other needed supplies.   Thank you  Todd Jersey Architecture     There are similar stories throughout these encampments and we need many more tents donated. Patricia Moore, another resident, needs a Yurt as well because she cannot move her wheelchair in her tent. She needs daily wound care so we need to provide her with fresh bandages and medical supplies.   Patricia Moore in her current tent. She cannot walk and must crawl out of her tent to get into her wheelchair. She cannot roll her wheelchair into her tent so a yurt would give her accessibly and warmth in the winter months.   Winter is coming! These Berkeley residents need to be self-sufficient because city services cannot provide for all of their needs. They are asking the City of Berkeley for trash pick-up, porta potties, and drinking water. They would also like to purchase heavy duty trash bags and containers.  Help us help them to create a safe, clean, and weather proof environment.     Our goal is to purchase 50-60 weather proof tents. Unlike when a person goes camping temporarily, these tents will be used as a temporary HOME to get someone through the winter and secure their belongings. The money raised will go toward the purchase of tents and other winter supplies including waterproof tarps. Additionally, some of the money donated will go toward waste and trash management.   A portion of the money raised will provide 30-50 GoGirl's to women so that they can easily use the restroom in uncomfortable spaces.   Find out more information on the  GOGIRL on Amazon.      The donated supplies will be distributed throughout the encampments equally.  At the request of the residents, we will set up a donations tent so that other homeless individuals (throughout Berkeley)  can receive the supplies  they need. The donations tent will be run by the unhoused residents themselves, who will work as volunteers, keeping inventory, and equally distributing supplies to all of the individuals living in the encampments.   Our new  Community Donations tent from Amazon.  Thank you Sarah W for this contribution!     The unhoused in Berkeley are uniting to demand an answer to the question: Where do we go? Until they  can find a lawful place to be, please help them protect themselves and the most vulnerable in their community from the cold of winter. There are not enough shelter beds or housing. The most vulnerable are our senior citizens and disabled. These communities care and take care of their most vulnerable. They need our help.  The current solutions are not working. We need immediate solutions for this winter and community building. Please help us.    For a history of the Where do we go? movement see recent article by  JP Masser: An Intersecting Tale: Berkeley's #WhereDoWeGo Movement Stays Fast.    Please support  Street Spirit   and purchase a copy of the October 2019 edition from a homeless vendor in Berkeley.  Photo taken by Yessica Prado and Article written by Alastair Boone, published in the October 2019 edition of Street Spirit.   Tent design and photo taken by Suzi Garner.   We LOVE you Suzi! I cannot wait until we get Where do we go? t-shirts with your tents as the photo.",

This death was unexpected to everyone therefore the family was not financially ready to assume burial costs which we all know are ridiculously high these days. The reason for his passing was due to lung failure, which eventually lead to a heart attack. Our brother was admitted to the homestead hospital on Saturday 01/04/2020, he was in the ICU for a total of 5 days during which he fought his hardest to make it out of his coma but unfortunately his body couldn’t continue to fight and at 11:46 PM we lost a beautiful soul and gained an angel. Unfortunately, our loved one was heavy set which makes the costs be even higher than usual therefore with a heavy heart we are asking for donations, anything helps, we are very grateful for anything that can be donated to our family in this traumatic event. Thank you.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  El 1/09/2020, nuestro querido hijo, padre, hermano, tío y amigo fue tomado demasiado pronto de la familia Corona.

Desafortunadamente, nuestro ser querido tenía bastante sobre peso, lo cual hace que los costos sean aún más altos de lo habitual, por lo tanto, con un dolor en el corazón estamos pidiendo donaciones, cualquier cosa ayuda, estamos muy agradecidos por todo lo que se pueda donar a nuestra familia en este evento traumático.

    "description": "Hi,  my name is Miguel Zapien Corona and everyone calls me \"Miguelito\" (little Mike).  I am 1 year old from Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico.  Just few days before Christmas my mom took  me to the doctor because when she took a picture she could see on my right eye a strange light.    After the doctors appointment the nightmare started for my family....   We started performing some test and examinations with the ophthalmologist and they confirmed the diagnostic:  \"Retinoblastoma\" (eye cancer) in my right eye.  The tumor was \"large\"....... The worst fear that a mother could bear is to hear his baby has cancer and his life is in danger.   The doctors in Guadalajara wanted to remove my eye but we found the only clinic in Mexico (Hospital Zambrano Hellion) that can do a treatment with intra-arteriel chemotherapy (most likely 4-5 times)  to try to save my eye and my life.     However this treatment  is very expensive ($16,000 usd each treatment) that is not cover by my insurance plus  travel expenses to Monterrey several times.       I need to start treatment as soon as possible due the tumor is getting larger and could spread very soon.  I'm a happy kid and want to live.   There is still to much to discover and enjoy.   I will fight this battle against cancer beside God and my family.  Life can change in seconds.  Remember to Love with all your hearth and be grateful for every sunshine!  We thank you infinite for reading my story and helping us with your prayers and donation .  p.s. GoFundme donations are  dollars.    The fund for this campaign will be going to Miguelitos treatment: doctors appointments, test, chemio, travel expenses.  Thanks for your kind support       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Hola,  me llamo Miguel Zapien Corona,  todos me conocen como Miguelito.   Tengo 1 anio y naci en Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.

Despues de la cita con el doctor la pesadilla para mi familia comenzo.   Comenzamos a realizar examenes con el oftalmologo y lo confirmaron:  Retinoblastoma (cancer en mi ojo derecho).  El tumor era bastante grande......El peor temor que una madre puede esperar es escuchar que su bebe tiene cancer y su vida esta en peligro.     Los doctores en Guadalajara quireren remover mi ojo,  pero mi familia encontro la unica clinica en Mexico (Hospital Zambrano Hellion) que tiene un tratamiento llamado Quimioembolizacion de Retinoblastoma.     Miguelito es candidato y necesitaria 4 - 5 tratamientos para poder salvar mi ojo y mi vida.  Sin embargo este tratamiento es muy caro ($16,000 usd por tratamient) que no es cubierto por mi seguro y necesitamos viajar varias veces a Monterrey.  Necesito comenzar el tratamiento lo antes posible pues el tumor es muy grande y se puede esparcir a otras partes muy pronto.  Soy un nino muy alegre y quiero vivir!  Hay mucho que me queda por aprender y disfrutar.  Luchare esta batalla contra el cancer al lado de Dios y mi familia.  La vida cambia en segundos.  Recuerda Amar con todo tu corazon y agradecer por cada amanecer.  Te agradecemos infinitamente por leer mi historia y ayudarnos con tus rezos y donaciones.  Para donaciones en  Pesos  anexamos la cuenta.  O si gustar donar a traves de GoFundMe considera tipo de cambio de pesos a dollarses",

I recently lost my SNAP/EBT benefits so it’s already hard enough, and my mother is disabled and a senior citizen, so she is in the at risk population and lives with my family of 2 children and I. I am scared of missing work and not being able to pay my bills, but also TERRIFIED of continuing to go to work and contracting COVID-19 (CoronaVirus) and bringing it home to my 53 yr old mother, who already has a compromised immune system. She’s had Bronchitis pneumonia, diabetic, and overall just not a healthy person. She means the world to us, and this virus has really affected us because with her living in the home with us, there’s no way around it.  any help would be appreciated as we will probably be forced out of work soon.",

They often present with pneumonia-like symptoms.  The viruses are transmitted from animals to humans — the virus that causes SARS, for example, was transmitted to humans from a cat-like animal called a civet. But in some instances, as appears to be the case with this new strain of coronavirus, they can also be transmitted between humans.   The World Health Organization said there are multiple known coronaviruses circulating in animals that have not yet been transmitted to humans.

China  may not be able to contain  this New Coronavirus.  My name is Clark Tibbs in Ohio of the USA.    As we contribute $2,000, I will forward  all of the money  to the Vaccine Experts.  I am raising funding for several Vaccine Candidates vs. the New CoronaVirus (2019-nCoV) that is quickly spreading.       All of the funding  will go to the Expert Vaccine Authors/Scientists.   See this 'dreadful' and globally-important Report: Report 2: Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China   https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus      This team based at Imperial College London (on Jan. 22, 2020) reports a new estimate of 2019-nCoV activity in Wuhan, CHINA and said the city (with population similar to Chicago) probably now has 4,000 symptomatic cases. The report's 95% confidence interval ranges from  1,000 to 9,700.   The funding will go directly for Vaccine Development and the Clinical Trials. All of the Vaccine Scientists are in the USA.     The Viral Sequence for this (single stranded RNA) Virus is posted on the Internet and the GenBank Accession Number is well known by the Expert Vaccine Scientists that I am in contact with, daily.   The Vaccine Development Team will use the Tunable T-4 Lambda Phage Head Vaccine Platform.  This same Vaccine Platform proved successful vs. (1) Anthrax + (2) Plague in Rabbits (that were challenged).     You might want to call this current medical situation the 'beginning of a Pandemic', so we humans will need all of the disease-prevention tools that we can invent.   This may be the best vaccine tool because the mass-manufacturing process allows for many, many more administration units compared to other vaccine types and the manufacturing process is rapid, with few chances of contamination, like with eggs and insect parts.   Please write to Clark Tibbs with questions ... via GoFundMe.    Thanks you, ALL.",

    "description": "The Wuhan Coronavirus is spreading quickly. There have now been more than 400 cases in China with 17 dead, and a case has been detected in Washington State. Hospitals in Wuhan have been extremely full in the past few days. Fifteen first responders have been infected with the virus while trying to help others, but despite the risk, all the doctors in the respiratory department are working day and night nonstop despite the approaching Lunar New Year, a time traditionally for family reunions.     If we do not stop this infection in Wuhan, in China, it may very well spread all over the world. Recently, the Chinese Newspaper published a call to people around the world to donate to Wuhan to purchase much needed medical supplies to stop the virus. Please donate to these people fighting on the front line, so that we have a chance to stop the virus before it becomes the next SARS.  I will take the money donated, purchase the materials, and ship them to hospitals in Wuhan",

    "description": "I am an eight grade student attending middle school in California, and I am raising money to help the doctors and citizens in Wuhan, China, who are going through an virus outbreak crisis.  I would like to raise $3,000 to help provide approximately 10,000 disposable surgical masks to the city of Wuhan. Any donation is much appreciated, and all funds will go towards the purchase and shipping of the supplies to hospitals and epidemic prevention centers. Currently, doctors at some hospitals are only allocated one mask per day, while on active duty and treating infected patients. Furthermore, citizens are now required by the Wuhan government to wear face masks to prevent the spread of this virus.  A new coronavirus strain, a pneumonia-like respiratory virus, was recently discovered in China. The new virus is called 2019-nCoV and NBC News states that \"there is no specific treatment for the new virus, and no vaccine to prevent it.\" In December of 2019, there was a huge coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. CNN has confirmed that there are approximately 2,000 infected, while the death toll has risen to 56 people in China as of January 26th. The Wall Street Journal states that the virus has \"quickly spread throughout China and other countries in Asia, and . . . U.S. Health authorities expect that it will spread even further.\"  Wuhan is located in the middle of China and is by no means a small city, with an overall population of 11 million. It is also one of China's most important cities and is considered the political and economical capital of the country. Authorities have issued a citywide lockdown, and all public transport services throughout the city have been suspended until further notice. Main highways leaving Wuhan have been shut down, and airports and railway stations have been temporarily closed to departing passengers. The implementation of the blockade is an immense challenge to transport authorities and is also extremely difficult for people with relatives living in Wuhan. Chinese Lunar New Year is on January 25th this year, but many people cannot visit or see their relatives. CNN describes the situation as \"akin to closing down all transport links for a city more than three times the size of Chicago, two days before Christmas.\"  Thank you so much in advance to anyone who provides a donation, regardless of amount.  My plan: After receiving each $300 worth of donations, I will purchase as many masks as I can and send them to Wuhan Xie He Dongxihu Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, China (Jing Bei Yi Road, Wuhan, Dongxihu Qu). My parents will also directly call the hospital to ensure that they will know when the shipment arrives. All purchased masks will be shipped to China via a global courier company.",

Wuhan has been quarantined as health officials and the World Health Organization fear a possible global epidemic.  As such, a scarcity of these medical supplies has struck the area, leading many exposed to this dangerous disease. Death tolls are rising and we must act fast.  I am sending M3  N95 1860 and 1870 masks, respirators, Tyvex suits, and other relevant medical equipment to hospitals in Wuhan.

If any hospital from Wuhan or the surrounding areas would like to receive these items from us, please contact us! All money raised from this campaign will go towards the purchase of these supplies, and we are getting ready to complete our first purchases and will update immediately!  We are also looking to partner with hospitals who may have supplies to donate. If you are connected with any hospital or organization and would like to partner with us, please contact us!   武汉爆发的新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎疫情牵动着上万人的心，中国很多地区都出现了病例，世界各地也陆续出现了感染者。WHO 正在开会决定是否将其定为国际关注的突发公共卫生事件。病毒传播速度之快，危害之大超乎人们的想象。  更加令人担心的是，各地均不同程度出现医用口罩，防护服，护目镜，测温仪等防疫物资短缺现象。尤其是湖北省包括武汉地区医院的医护人员，没有足够的医用口罩等防护工具，依然坚持在防疫第一线，用自己的血肉之躯保卫着人民的生命！ 这些令人肃然起敬的白衣天使们，我们希望发动更多的人行动起来，能为他们出一份力。  我们发起这次募捐，将把捐款用于医用口罩，防护服，护目镜，测温仪，测试盒等防疫物资的购买和运费。我们将协调供应商，货运公司，各航司，地方医院等相关部门，最大程度地把这些物资送到医生手中，给他们带来一份保护！我们也希望能够筹集到更多的防疫物资，送到需要的市民手中。  同时希望各地方的医疗机构能够联系我们，给我们提供更多的医疗物资。我们也欢迎各种形式的帮助，请点击下方链接联系我们。",

    "description": "Hello everyone,   You may have heard of the recent outbreak of coronavirus in the city of Wuhan in China. It is a novel virus which is very contagious and causes life-threatening pneumonia in people of all ages.  Unfortunately, there is still no cure for it.   - As of 1/24/2020 8pm local time, it has been reported that  26  people died of this virus infection and  928  are infected in China.   - Numbers keep increasing  exponentially  as more cases were confirmed in Wuhan City and Hubei Province, other provinces of China, other Asian countries and the rest of the world.   - First case infected from this coronavirus in North America was found in Seattle 1/21/2020, and the second case was confirmed in Chicago yesterday 1/23/2020.    - A student of Texas A M University was suspected for possible coronavirus infection after his recent trip to Wuhan yesterday 1/23/2020.  - As of today, China restricts travel of 30 million people in Wuhan as coronavirus death toll rises. City of Wuhan is currently cut off from the rest of the world. All transportation including flights, trains, subways, even personal automobiles etc., have been suspended until further notice. There is very limited supply of gas in all gas station in Wuhan. All schools have been cancelled. For quarantine purpose, no single Wuhan resident is allowed to leave the city.   Here are some reports from major media about this critical situation.     https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-hnk-intl-01-24-20/index.html      https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/wuhan-coronavirus-china-intl-hnk/index.html      https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html      https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/health-science/2020/01/23/358285/officials-investigating-suspected-case-of-coronavirus-in-brazos-county/    As a native from the city of Wuhan, I am heartbroken about this situation. I am currently a biomedical scientist in Houston; both of my parents are doctors in a major hospital in Wuhan. They witness more and more patients, as well as doctors are infected by this lethal virus. The only way that can effectively prevent this virus from spreading is as simple as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), such as  surgical masks ,  N95 aspirators, safety glasses and goggles, and   protective coveralls . Unfortunately, there are more than 11 million people living in Wuhan; currently PPE is extremely short of supply in Wuhan, as well as in the rest area of China. Even worse,  today is the Chinese New Year of Mouse . Millions of people are suffering and their lives are in danger. Production and supply of PPE in China has no way to meet the demand in a timely manner.  We are wondering if any of you can help in any ways, such as funds donation, and/or donation of any number of PPE, and/or help with getting any PPE donation from major manufacturers in the States. I will then coordinate to have them shipped to China as soon as I can.    Earlier, Better.  It will not only help people in Wuhan, but provide further protection for people all of the world, including your beloved ones, from being infected by this contiguous life-threatening virus. I currently live in Houston. I am more than happy to coordinate and help by all means, and make it possible.    Where the funds go, and how the funds are used, will be frequently updated here with all available validated documentation.   (Update 1/28/2020)  One of our local ambassadors in Wuhan, Sibo (Bob) Hu, took this video at his home in Wuhan today 1/28/2020.

    "description": "January 25, 2019, marks the beginning of the Chinese New Year, but the citizens of Wuhan are experiencing anything but prosperity. The recent outbreak of coronavirus has devastated the population, with thousands already confirmed to be infected and climbing death tolls every day. Hospitals throughout the province are suffering from an undersupply of medical resources and are pleading for outside support. Recently, a doctor died combatting the virus because they did not have enough protection.  Many people like me have relatives who live in China and are living in constant fear of infection with no way to escape. My uncle's family and my cousins are currently quarantined in the province, and I am personally very worried for their well-being.   I have contacts with hospital officials and medical organizations in Wuhan linked to HUST, where my uncle works. This money will go towards protective gear such as goggles, face masks, and disposable coats that doctors currently need. Details are provided in the \"donating\" section of this document.  A famous phrase in Chinese is \"众志成城\" (United as one). I believe that this community is a supportive platform for fundraising efforts and knowledge of current world issues. If everyone contributes a small amount, our efforts will become a powerful force in the fight against this calamity.",

    "description": "Hello everyone, I am Bin Ni (my real name). I am from Shanghai, China. I am an international student in Vancouver BC. I am organizing fundraising to support Wuhan and China fighting coronavirus. All the donations will be donated to Wuhan Red Cross every two to three days instead of waiting for hitting the target because it is very URGENT!   I hope anyone who lives on this earth can join this fight and nib this threat at the beginning. In order to do that, Wuhan China needs help from all of you.  As we all know, the coronavirus that starts from Wuhan China is very deadly and can be transmitted through the air. No known treatment has been proven effective toward the coronavirus. The reported cases have been doubled several times over the last two weeks. Confirmed cases have reached 1362 in mainland China and other 38 confirmed cases have been reported all over the world.   Feb 24th is Lunar new year for Chinese people which means it is when Chinese goes home and unite with families and celebrate. This means that most organizations and even the government are functioning with very few staff and resources. This makes fighting this battle so much harder at the beginning and has made a time window that can effectively contain the virus much smaller.  Wuhan hospitals’ medical workers are working three shifts a day for the last two weeks due to an overwhelming number of patients and limited staff.  Overworked Chinese doctor collapses from exhaustion   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZHhPr9Xx8   Chinese hospital staff in Wuhan face fears amid a frontline battle against coronavirus outbreak   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7llqJcvkxM   Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak: pity doctor crying   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpoRDm4zCA   you may not understand Chinese, but I believe you can hear desperation from his voice.  15 medical workers have been contracted with the virus and one doctor Lian Wudong has sacrificed his life in this battle. Here is a video to mourn this hero.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyOXPhSsfNI   Why Wuhan needs your support and how bad the situation is right now??  If you are only reading news from western media, you may not feel as related as I do. I will explain this to you in examples you may feel more relaxed.  Wuhan is the biggest city in Hubei Province. They have the best hospital, medical equipment and doctors in the provinces. Yet they are still struggling not only because the virus is impossible to treat at this stage but also they don’t have enough medical supplies like goggles, masks, protective suits. Other cities and towns in Hubei Province, many of them are, I don’t want to say this but, are third-world and there are huge populations in those cities. This is actually the worst part of all situation. An outbreak can happen at any moment.  I will continue to add more information to this post.  If you are in Vancouver and willing to meet me in person, I will be happy to meet you. We can come together and strategize a bigger plan to prepare for the worst situation.  I will also connect universities and colleges to join us in fundraising.   No preparation will be too much until the virus is fully contained and completely eliminated from this earth.        1.       Donation Channel 1: All the donation will go to Wuhan Red Cross (this is the one you are reading right now)  2.       Donation Channel 2: All the donations will be used to order a medical supply for Wuhan Hospital. The factory in China will take the order and manufacture supplies and sent them directly to Wuhan hospitals. (Will be opened in next few days)  All the activities will be posted on social media and can be monitored by anyone.",

    "description": "China is facing a major virus outbreak. Now, the whole entire population have high demands for medical masks (3M). Not only does the public need these to protect themselves, doctors and nurses are in need for these masks. Medical masks are selling out in China, let's raise money to buy medical masks for the people who need them in the Wuhan crisis.  I am a high school student with a Chinese background. Having parents who immigrated from China almost 10 years ago, I still have relatives and friends living in China. There is no doubt that I am worried about them with the highly contagious virus surrounding them.   With more people being admitted to hospitals, the virus is spreading, and doctors and nurses are in need for medical equipment. As doctors and nurses attempt to save patients, masks are very critical to them as they can prevent the virus from spreading. 15 nurses have confirmed to be in contact with the virus due to attempting to save others, but more have yet to come. These people in the medical field are spending time in the hospital saving lives rather than celebrating the 2020 Chinese new year, they should be appreciated and also supported. Not only in the medical field, masks are also worn by the public. These single use masks are bought and thrown everyday, and the demand for these only increase. As many places are in need for masks, I hope to raise money to support hospital facilities in China.   While normal masks are good, we need to buy N95 medical masks. These masks are more safe and are used in hospital facilities. I hope to raise money to buy these masks, then ship them to hospitals in China to save lives.   I hope to: 1) Raise enough money and reach our goal 2) Buy N95 medical masks  3) Ship to Wuhan XieHe hospital, Wuhan Medical Treatment Center (JingYiTan Hospital)) along with other hospitals that need it.   It would be so kind of you for your support, every penny counts. :)    https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html    Edit/Update: First batch ordered! Waiting for masks to arrive then I will ship them off!",

    "description": "By now, many of you have probably heard of the Chinese coronavirus spreading throughout Asia and now spreading to Europe, Australia, and even the United States.   The purpose of this fundraiser is to gather money for the CAIPA Foundation, which will partner with organizations to provide aid to Wuhan. As Wuhan is desperately trying to quarantine and supply medical support to all infected, they need supplies.  Together we can aid Wuhan in their fight against this deadly disease and prevent a worldwide pandemic.   All money raised goes directly to the CAIPA Foundation, which is a non-profit organization that partners with many NYC hospitals. It is the foundation for the Chinese American IPA (CAIPA).   For more information about the coronavirus:   As of 1/25/20: The  Health Commission of Hubei Province  reports that the total number of deaths linked to the fast-spreading virus in China is up to 41, three of which were outside of Wuhan Province.  There are also now 1,372 confirmed cases across China, though most are concentrated in those provinces closest to Hubei, as seen below.  As of 1/26/20: Canada has now reported its first confirmed case of the coronavirus, and the United States just had another case in Orange County, California. That brings the total number of cases to 3 in the united states, and the worldwide death toll has increased to 56. Worldwide confirmed cases of the coronavirus has now reached 2,019     As of 1/29/20: The death toll has risen to 132 in China, with 6,078 confirmed cases of infection as of Wednesday evening local time — a day-over-day increase of more than 1,000. Other countries in the region also are reporting more people infected — nearly all of them tourists from China.   As of 1/30/20: The number of deaths in China reaches 213, while confirmed infections near 10,000. The new coronavirus has been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China. (There had been 98 cases in 18 other countries, but no deaths).   There have been eight cases of human-to-human infection - in Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and the United States.    To see an updated map of the spread of the virus:    https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/22/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?arc404=true     Countries and territories that have confirmed cases: Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Macau, Russia, France, the United States, South Korea, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Britain, Vietnam, Italy, India, the Philippines, Nepal, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Finland.    Cases recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Germany, Vietnam, Japan, France, and the United States involved patients who had not been to China.",

At the moment i am in China because i wanted to celebrate Chinese new year so i am in the middle of all the problems that are occur at the moment. the sick people that cant reach out for an hospital are laying on the streets because there are not enough beds and space. But instead of only reading about all the problems i feel the need of helping out the people in the infected area.  I think that the best place to gather money for the people that need it the most is here on the platform gofundme. if anyone has any other ideas to help out the people in china send me an email “jurrys@outlook.com”  even if you dont want to donate money but you have supplies like facemasks and gloves it would be much apreciated. We need to stop the virus from spreading around and stop this disaster from getting even bigger.  lets  unite  and help out the victims of this virus.  \n \n\n   Update  4/02/2020. The victims that are infected at the moment is over 20.000 and the people that have died is 425. Those numbers are to big because its hard for al these people to get the medical supplies and protection that they need.  Ive spend almost al my savings just to hand out facemasks and gloves for everyone that wants it but its just not enough.\n \n\n I hope i can keep doing this with your help. 50 facemasks at the moment costs around 40 dollars U.S.\n \n\n If there is a place to get it cheaper please send me and email or respond on this platform.",

    "description": "I am raising money to buy and transport n-95 masks and individual hand sanitizers to the homeless population in West Los Angeles and hopefully beyond.      As you may know the Wuhan Caronavirus has quickly made it to the United States. Recently a traveler from China by way of Mexico City landed at LAX. It was a random screening that they found this person to have symptoms of this virus.  CDC directed this person to the hospital immediately.      Towards the end of January a scheduled flight of private citizens from Wuhan will land at SFO. We have not as a country,  state or planet quarantined this virus.  There will hopefully be a vaccine,  but that will take months.  It is a very real illness and only in it's infancy.      Many may get ill, but won't die.  It has been suggested by the CDC  based on previous carona virus outbreaks (SARS, MERS) that the people most at risk will be those who are most vulnerable and disadvantaged.  Underlying health conditions is seen in homelessness at an alarmingly high rate.  The lack of resources,  education and safety will put them at risk for catching this virus.     They live in our communities, we see them every day. That alone puts us at risk, too.  This is highly contagious and is thought to be spread via respiratory droplets, but it is also demonstrating that it can spread exponentially from a point of contact.  Meaning you don't have to be exposed to the sick person  to get the virus.    N-95 masks  protect and prevent droplet transmission.  Alcohol sanitization promotes good hygiene and is recommended by the CDC to be included in prevention measures.      The masks are expensive and it's not realistic to believe that the homeless could afford one if they knew they needed it. Education is essential.      I will go out into the community and reach out to those willing to be educated and provide them with supplies to protect themselves.  This to help out not only the homeless, but our community as well.     My experience to take on this project is 10+ years working as an ER/ICU nurse in  America's largest busiest hospitals, including those right here in Los Angeles. I have a lot of experience interacting with homeless and reaching out to meet their needs. I have also worked as a nurse educator, a pharmaceutical research developer, legal nurse consulting and most importantly a patient advocate.    I get good results.  I want to help.     I have some volunteers that will be working with me as well. If you'd like to donate your time please contact me.   CDC reference  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html",

After 6 months of working over in Shanghai, a Carona virus has broken out, and they are trying to get out with their lives! So far the Chinese students have been put under quarantine until 2/29 but the adults are still able to get out, as of now. The availability on flights are booked full in coach so each one had to buy a one way ticket in business class. Now they are under time pressure to get out before a full quarantine goes into effect or before they are stricken with the virus. If they make it out, they will immediately be unemployed and facing the cost of their airfair out. Please help these two make it home safely and expeditiously with no credit card debt, as a result of last minute airfair. Any donation amount would be Greatly Appreciated.

    "description": "Coronavirus, a newly discovered illness that can evolve, infect humans, and spread between humans, is threatening hundreds of millions of people's life. The outbreak started in China, Wuhan, in December 2019. It is more contagious than SARS. Currently, there is NO cure for this illness. According to the government's report, in China, 2785 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus. 5794 people are suspected of being infected. 81 people have died. The actual number of infections and deaths is much bigger than the reported ones. Due to the lack of facilities and sickbed positions in hospitals, many people are only waiting for deaths at home.  Every day hundreds of people are diagnosed with coronavirus. Wuhan, a city of eleven million people, has temporarily shut down to inhibit the rapid spreading of the virus.  Medical facilities, food, and masks have been depleted. The only masks that work to prevent infection are n95, 3M, and surgical masks. However, they can only be used for 4 hours per mask. Thus, not even Chinese citizens, doctors and nurses who are treating the infected patients are facing the scarcity of masks. Worse, five millions of Wuhan citizens have fled to other cities of China before the shutdown, which means the number of potentially infected people is unimaginable. China estimates that the peak of the infection rate will be around mid-February, meaning the most devastating crisis has yet to come. In all Chinese cities, schools are delayed and all public facilities are shut down.   Moreover, coronavirus has spread overseas. According to CNN, there are more than 50 confirmed cases in 13 places outside of mainland China, including at least five in the United States. Furthermore, people can spread the virus before symptoms show.   Facing the devil himself, instead of retreating to obtain a chance of living, thousands of Chinese doctors and nurses voluntarily signed petitions to treat infected patients. Now, at least 30 doctors and nurses have been infected. Some have already passed away. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people's lives are at stake. The only way we can help them is to purchase a massive amount of masks, goggles, protective suits, and medical facilities, and transport them to China. This takes lots of money. We need your help to fight against this menacing illness.",

In the news, friends of friends, the NBA community, and everyone's social media posts. I cannot escape it, death, they say it’s inevitable, but I've never had trouble forgetting.    Funerals and deathly illnesses seem so beyond my twenty-two-year-old life, and surely, the intellects would find a cure, and everything will be fine. But these days, death leaves no escape reminding everyone that life is short and death, inevitable.   In recent news, death has stacked up like coins slotting in connect four. Articles and videos scream for attention as hourly updates on the coronavirus create fear and confusion. Political agendas have started, and fear uncovers ignorance as racist comments blaze, blaming and burning the Chinese.    I sit in my home in Canada, as I witness doctors fainting and family members shouting in desperation for their loved ones in lack of beds and medical supplies on the other side of the globe. At the same time, patients are in isolation, not knowing whether the new virus will claim their lives.   I wait for it to pass, dodging coughs and sneezes while mumbling a simple prayer hoping my pack of face masks and beliefs will be enough to keep me from falling ill. I'm thankful it's not me who is quarantined.   Yet with each new death toll, and hourly update, my sitting here is not enough. I click another video and the desperation of those isolated and afraid force tears in my eyes.   A few fundraisers that have already popped up, but I started this one for my community. If I'm honest, I'm still hesitant in creating this, as doubt forms silly questions, “Will I meet or even come close to my goal?” I have decided not to let it stop me.    I will be raising money to fight the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, by running 1km for every $50 donated while wearing a mask.    If I meet my goal of $5k, the money will be donated to  Give2Asia,  who has partnered with leading Chinese public health organizations to support frontline health workers and hospitals responding to the coronavirus crisis.  For more information:    https://give2asia.org/donate-help-fight-coronavirus-outbreak-wuhan-china/       Your donations will be used for:  ·      Procuring masks, protection suits, goggles, and other necessary medical equipment for the treatment and containment ·      Providing meals and lodging to the thousands of health workers traveling to areas most affected by the outbreak ·      Long-term training and support for medical workers working on the front lines of this and future epidemics",

    "description": "Hi everyone. I'm raising money to donate to Give2Asia, who will be able to fund for medical supplies, food, and proper long-term medical training for those currently living in the quarantined province of Hubei in China. Any donation will help make an impact. As we are all aware, the coronavirus has been responsible for the deaths of 81 people worldwide, and over 2,800 people infected worldwide. These numbers are bound to keep rising as the coronavirus is an extremely contagious airborne disease with no current known cure. Major hospitals in China in the Hubei province, the site of the first recorded cases of the virus, have reported a dangerous shortage of medical supplies such as goggles, Level A Hazmat suits, masks, and gloves. With the entire province of Hubei in lockdown, citizens would also inevitably suffer from a shortage of food, water, and other necessary daily supplies. This virus is spreading quickly worldwide, and we need to do everything in our power to help in the efforts of stopping the rapid spread of this disease before its extensive damage and resulting casualties reaches the rest of the world. All donations would immediately go to the nonprofit organization Give2Asia. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause. Every single penny makes a difference.  More information about Give2asia (G2a): Our mission is to strengthen communities throughout Asia by building trusted networks for charitable investment. We envision healthy and prosperous communities supported by an expanded flow of philanthropy and locally-led development. Our work focuses on key issues such as healthcare, the environment, disaster preparedness and relief, and poverty alleviation. We believe that local knowledge counts: Give2Asia has a team of local staff, in-country advisors, and partners in every country where we work, ensuring projects are effective, results are transparent, and grant recipients are accountable.  Give2Asia is one of the few international NGOs registered to support local causes in China. We are honored to have received special permission from Chinese authorities to accept donations to support local response efforts for this crisis.\n \n\n Our nonprofit partners in China have provided a preliminary needs assessment. Your donations will be used for:  - Procuring masks, protection suits, goggles, and other necessary medical equipment for the treatment and containment - Providing meals and lodging to the thousands of health workers traveling to areas most affected by the outbreak - Long-term training and support for medical workers working on the front lines of this and future epidemics",

    "title": "Coronavirus Fundraiser for Wuhan, China",
    "description": "Hello everyone,  My name is Vivian Hu, and I am currently a senior at Laguna Blanca High School in Santa Barbara, California. I grew up in Wuhan, China. In fact, many of my family and friends still reside there.  Sunday January 26th was the Chinese New Year – in our culture, it is the time when people in China are the most lively and happy. It is our practice that everyone puts down their hard work and studies to return home and be surrounded by family and friends. But this Chinese New Year everything changed completely with the outbreak of a new deadly disease commonly referred to as the Coronavirus.   The Coronavirus is a new virus that has been transmitted from animals to humans. The mutation of the virus becomes stronger as it moves on from person to person. The person who is infected with the disease will develop a fever, cough, inflammation of both lungs, kidney failure, and the last stage which leads to death. According to official Chinese statistics, more than 45,000 people have been infected in mainland China alone. Approximately 1,357 people have died from the Coronavirus worldwide, a number that is expected to rise each day.    The Coronavirus outbreak particularly touches me, as well as my friends and family. Most of the infected and diseased people live in my hometown of Wuhan. Due to the sudden outbreak, the hospitals are at full capacity of patients, and medical teams have not received any rest since the outbreak. This virus overlapped with the Spring Festival traffic, causing a series of problems in the spreading of the virus with more human contact. As you may already know, the government made a decision to shut down all pathways leading in and out of Wuhan. Therefore, essentially shutting down my hometown. People will no longer have access to railways, highways, and airports until further notice. This official shutdown has caused the people of my hometown an even greater danger and inconvenience. The people of Wuhan know that the shutdown is not to seal the freedom of life of millions of citizens there, but to prevent the virus from spreading out of Wuhan. The city of Wuhan is taking steps to prevent the spreading of the virus.  One, being that the government has built two independent hospitals outside of the city—with the capacity to treat 3,000 people.     Because of this nationally-known epidemic, the demand for face masks and protective medical clothing is running critically low. In particular, face masks are out of stock at nearly all of the drug stores in the city and many people are unable to purchase what can potentially save their life.   The money raised by this fundraiser will be used to buy SP Surgical Masks through Wing Sea Co., Ltd. in Japan. There is currently a shortage of face masks available worldwide, but this supplier has agreed to work with me to ensure that medical grade face masks make it to Wuhan. All masks will be sent by the supplier directly to Hankou Hospital in Wuhan, China, where they will be distributed as necessary throughout the community. I am in direct communication with the supplier and will ensure that the money gets to them and that the face masks make it to the Hankou Hospital in Wuhan.  The citizens of Wuhan need our encouragement, support, and help immediately. I ask that you be mindful and show your appreciation as they are sacrificing their own health to ensure that the virus does not spread any further.  As a Wuhan native in the United States, I can only put in my modest efforts.  PLEASE DONATE NOW TO THE PEOPLE OF WUHAN   Thank you in advance for your donation so that I can support my hometown of Wuhan from here.",
